I'm a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for Software Development. I specialize in Mechatronics and System Controls, and I love using technology to solve problems and create impactful solutions.

## 🚀 About Me

<!-- A short bio -->
I've been working in the tech industry for 2 years, focusing on software tools for automotive test automation. I have designed and developed many software applications that integrate into test flows, such as:

- Automatic Code Generation & Configuration
- Big Data Analysis
- Automatic Report Generation
- Simulation of real environments integrating commercial software and hardware with my applications

I'm passionate about open-source and believe in the power of collaboration. In my free time, I enjoy learning new skills across a wide range of topics. I have played the piano since I was a child and, because of this, I love all kinds of good music, from Classical to Techno.

I love sharing my knowledge with anyone eager to listen. I may not be the best teacher, but I do it with passion!

## 🌐 My Github Pages
It's just an example of presentation of my VisualCoding desktop application (repo pinned below) but is nice!

I'm currently deep diving into Neural Networks and how to make them learn to solve (not so) simple tasks like playing a videogame.
