## ðŸš€ About Me

<!-- A short bio -->
I've been working in the tech industry for 2 years, focusing on software tools for automotive test automation. I have designed and developed many software applications that integrate into test flows, such as:

- Automatic Code Generation & Configuration
- Big Data Analysis
- Automatic Report Generation
- Simulation of real environments integrating commercial software and hardware with my applications

I'm passionate about open-source and believe in the power of collaboration. In my free time, I enjoy learning new skills across a wide range of topics. I have played the piano since I was a child and, because of this, I love all kinds of good music, from Classical to Techno.

I love sharing my knowledge with anyone eager to listen. I may not be the best teacher, but I do it with passion!
